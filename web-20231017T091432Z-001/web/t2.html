                    <h3 style="color: aqua;"> FORT KOCHI </h3>
                    <P style="color: white;">Fort Kochi takes its name from the Fort Manuel of Cochin,[1] the first European fort on Indian soil, controlled by the Portuguese East Indies.[2] This is part of a handful of water-bound islands and islets toward the south-west of the mainland Kochi, and collectively known as Old Cochin or West Cochin. Adjacent to this is the locality of Mattancherry. In 1967, these three municipalities along with a few adjoining areas, were amalgamated to form the Kochi Municipal Corporation.

Fort Kochi is rich in heritage and culture, and is a prominent tourist destination for both domestic and international travellers- being ranked as ninth among the top 25 in National Geographicâ€™s Top Tourist Destinations To Explore In 2020.[3]</P>
